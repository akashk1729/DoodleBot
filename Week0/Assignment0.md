# DoodleBot Image Processing Assignment

## Objective
Process a hand-drawn image and extract clean, drawable paths suitable for a DoodleBot, using image processing techniques only.

![Description](./Input_image.jpg)

Pardon the shabby drawing ;)

## Task
Given a hand-drawn image:
- Extract all relevant drawable structures using image processing.
- Apply necessary transformations and corrections (e.g., homography).
- Display meaningful visual outputs for each major step.
- Export the path data in a suitable format.

## Requirements
Your script should visualize:
- The original image
- Preprocessed image (e.g., thresholded or binarized)
- Edge or contour detections
- Skeletonized or thinned paths
- Final processed image with drawable paths overlaid

## Deliverables
- A Google Colab notebook or Python script
- Output figures for each stage of processing
- Visualization of the path data obtained after preprocessing through img procesing techniques
- Dedicate a readme file describing the process through which the final solution was arrived

## Disclaimer
- The processes outlined in the requirements are not the only ones that must be used in the solution, they provide a basic framework to guide you. The main focus should be on extracting the most optimal path from the given input image.
